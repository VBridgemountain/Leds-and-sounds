# Leds-and-sounds
Leds and lights for thermal detonator (starwars prop)
 going to try to create a code for arduino esp32 or a rp pico that when you pusch one button the it comes a on sound and four white led lights goes on and three of them blink in 1-2-3 steps like wandring. and when i puch another button a activated sound comes on and the colours turn red and goes 1-2-3 but a little bit faster, 
 and when i pusch the button that turned the red lights on again they go back to white colour and calms down in the 1-2-3 steps again and a deactivate sound goes on? and when i pusch the first button again that turned everything on it will shut the thing down and a sound goes on that is for total deactivation.
 it is going to be separate RGB leds and a small speaker. one slite button and one push button. also LiPo battery that is rechargeable thru usb C port.
